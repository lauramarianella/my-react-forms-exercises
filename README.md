Instructions
For each question, create a new react app using create-react-app or the basic boilerplate
Question 1

Make a form with 2 text inputs: first name and last name. It also has a submit button.

When the user clicks the submit button, make a popup that says something like "Hello Bob Dole" where Bob is the first name entered by the user and Dole the last.

Question 2

Start this one from scratch if question 1 had ANY challenge.

Add a button to clear the fields of question 1. This button will clear the two input fields.

Question 3

Start this one from scratch if question 2 had ANY challenge.

Same as question 2, except the submit button appears only if the user has typed something into BOTH input boxes. Otherwise, there is no submit button and the user will be unable to submit.

Do NOT use css to do this question

Question 4

Start this one from scratch if question 3 had ANY challenge.

Same as question 3, but add another button that swaps the text of the two input boxes. In other words, the first name becomes the last name and the last name becomes the first name.

Question 5

Start this one from scratch if question 4 had ANY challenge.

So far we've only had 1 form. Now we want to have two forms. The first form will be the same as question 4. The second form will ask: "Give us feedback on this page" with an input box and its own submit button. When the user clicks on the submit box, a popup appears that says something like "you've submitted 234 characters of feedback" where 234 is the number of characters of the string entered in the input box by the user.

Question 6 (advanced)

Only do this question if you have no other homework to do.

Long forms can be annoying to fill out. Sometimes it's a good idea to split a form into two parts. When the user submits the first part, the second one appears.

Create a react app with a form that's split into two parts.
